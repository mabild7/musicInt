# musicInt

This program makes use of the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) API to create
a music interpreter on the command line. As such, you will need to install the SFML
API. Details on how to run the program and to compile are found at the SFML website, and will be shortly
provided here.

This project was created to showcase my love for music and programming all in one package :)
